## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
-   See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
-   View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

-   React
-   TypeScript
-   Tailwind-CSS

### What I learned

I wanted to try a bit of css animations by adding an animation for the bar graph to grow when it loads up -- it was a lot simpler to do than I thought it would be!
